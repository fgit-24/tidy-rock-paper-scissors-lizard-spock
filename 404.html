    <h1>404 Error: Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>✊✋✌️🤏🖖</p>
    <p>Oops! Looks like you made the wrong move!</p>
    <p>Rock couldn't smash it, Paper didn't cover it, Scissors failed to cut it, Lizard didn't eat it, and Spock couldn't logically find it.</p>
    <p>But don't worry, it's not the end of the universe! Let's get you back to the home page.</p>
    <a href="index.html">Beam me up, Scotty!</a>
    <p>Remember: The universe is vast, and even Spock can't predict every outcome. But you can always try again and make the next move count.</p>
    <p>🖖 Live long and browse on!</p>
