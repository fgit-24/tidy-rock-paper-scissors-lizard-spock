# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
Enhanced with the powerful Lizard and the wise Spock, my game offers a delightful twist on the classic 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game.

It brings added depth and excitement compared to the original version!

## UX
I endeavored to maintain a clean and minimalist design for my page, yet I was equally committed to ensuring it remained visually appealing and responsive. 

After crafting my wireframe, I diligently brought it to life.

![Color Scheme](documentation/02-color-scheme.png)

Blue is a modern and neutral color that perfectly complements my vision of this classic and expresses it visually.

- 'ffffff' used for primary text.
- '000000' used for secondary text.
- '1681d9' used for button.
- '66abff' used for radient background.
- '376af7' used for radient background.
- '073487' used for headlines.


## Root-Variables
I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

    :root {
        --bg-color: white;
        --ft-color: rgb(7, 52, 135);
        font-size: 1rem;
    }


## Typography
I've used Google Fonts and 'Poppins' in most parts, and 'Oswald' for h1.

### Poppins
[Poppins](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald:wght@200..700&family=Poppins:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&display=swap)

### Oswald

[Oswald](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald:wght@200..700&display=swap)


### Icon
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.


## Wireframe
To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design my site wireframes.

For help with my JavaScript, I've watched a video von Youtube from [BroCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKdQx-SZ5A), but my version is much more advanced and complex.
